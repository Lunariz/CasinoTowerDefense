The Goal
Casino Tower Defense was created during a 48 hour GameJam organized by DGDARC at the University of Utrecht.
The theme of the GameJam was 'Gameception'
Because we only had 48 hours, the outcome obviously is not all we wanted it to be, but we are still proud of what we managed to create.

The Team
Our team consisted of:
Lukas Donkers
Aart Stuurman
Hilko Kleissen
Pepijn Thijssens

We all worked an equal amount on programming, design and art.

The Implementation
We decided to create the game in Visual Studio with XNA, because that was where all our teammembers had the most experience.
Because of the timelimit, we spent little time on design before starting (approximately 1 hour). We held multiple small meetings to discuss further ideas and design.
Because of the theme (Gameception), we added a unique mechanic where the placement of towers is decided through minigames: a slot machine and a claw machine
We used an in-house version of SVN to manage version control.

The Outcome
While we are proud of what we managed to create, the outcome obviously was not all we wanted it to be due to the timelimit, but we are still proud of what we managed to create.
In the future, if we would like to continue this project, we would most likely start with the most prevalent issues:
- Lack of comments
- Gamebreaking bugs
- Lack of feedback loops (a game design problem)
- Art quality
